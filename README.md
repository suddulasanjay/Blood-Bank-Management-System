# Blood-Bank-Management-System
This project aims to develop a Blood Bank Management System. A Blood Bank Management System can be used in any clinic, hospital, labs or any emergency situation which requires blood units for survival. Our system can be used to find required type of blood in emergency situations from either blood bank or even blood donors.
